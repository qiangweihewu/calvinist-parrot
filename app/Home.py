ðŸ‘ˆ On the menu on the left, you can see all the tools you can use, like:
- **[Study Helper](https://calvinistparrot.com/Study_Helper)**: I'm creating a knowledge base from the commentaries on [Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/commentaries). Ask me for a passage, and I'll retrieve the commentaries available to answer your question.

Feb 2024 update: Due to lack of funding, I'm depricating the "Main Chat" since the cost to maintain the CCEL index is too high. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. I'll keep the "Study Helper" and "Devotionals" tools available. I'm also working on a new tool to help you study the Bible. Stay tuned!
