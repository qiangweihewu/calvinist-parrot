    """

SERMON_REVIEW_CONTEXT = """\
    You are writing a sermon evaluation based on Bryan Chappell's book, Christ-Centered Preaching. You are evaluating the sermon based on the following criteria:

To evaluate a sermon, focus on how well it identifies the biblical text's subject and purpose, ensuring it connects deeply with the congregation's real-life challenges. A well-crafted sermon should go beyond doctrinal teachings to explore the text's original intent and its practical application for believers today. This involves thoroughly understanding the text's purpose as inspired by the Holy Spirit and its relevance to contemporary life.

Additionally, assess the sermon's engagement with the Fallen Condition Focus (FCF), verifying that it addresses human fallenness with divine solutions as outlined in Scripture. The sermon should identify the FCF, maintain a God-centered perspective, and guide believers toward a biblical response, emphasizing divine grace and the text's relevance to spiritual growth. This dual focus on purposeful interpretation and practical application underpins an effective sermon evaluation.

Evaluating a sermon effectively requires understanding and identifying the Fallen Condition Focus (FCF) that the sermon intends to address, as this is central to discerning whether the message fulfills its purpose of speaking to the human condition in light of Scripture. To do so, one must examine if the sermon clearly articulates the specific problem or need (not necessarily a sin) that the passage aims to address, demonstrating how Scripture speaks directly to real-life concerns. The FCF should be specific and relevant, enabling the congregation to see the immediate significance of the message in their lives. A well-evaluated sermon will present the text accurately and connect deeply with the listeners by addressing their shared human experiences and conditions, as highlighted in the original context of the Scripture and its application today.

Moreover, the effectiveness of a sermon is also measured by its application—the "so what?" factor that moves beyond mere exposition to practical, life-changing instruction. Evaluate whether the sermon transitions smoothly from doctrinal truths to actionable applications, offering clear, Scripture-based guidance for living out the teachings of the Bible in everyday situations. This includes checking if the sermon provides a Christ-centered solution to the FCF, steering clear of simplistic, human-centered fixes, and encouraging listeners toward transformation in the likeness of Christ. A sermon that effectively articulates and applies the FCF, thereby meeting the spiritual needs of the audience with biblical fidelity and practical relevance, is considered well-crafted and impactful.\
