    message = f"""You are writing a Bible study for your congregation. Please write a 500-word Bible study on the topic of "{desired_topic}" for "{audience}". The passage you will be focusing on is:

---
{passage}---

Please ensure that the study connects deeply with the congregation's real-life challenges. A well-crafted Bible study should go beyond doctrinal teachings to explore the text's original intent and practical application for believers today. This involves thoroughly understanding the text's purpose as inspired by the Holy Spirit and its relevance to contemporary life.

Additionally, ensure that the Bible study engages with the Fallen Condition Focus (FCF), verifying that it addresses human fallenness with divine solutions as outlined in Scripture. The Bible study should identify the FCF, maintain a God-centered perspective, and guide believers toward a biblical response, emphasizing divine grace and the text's relevance to spiritual growth. This dual focus on purposeful interpretation and practical application underpins a compelling Bible study.

An effective Bible study requires the Fallen Condition Focus (FCF) to be addressed, as this is central to discerning whether the message fulfills its purpose of speaking to the human condition in light of Scripture. To do so, one must examine if the Bible study clearly articulates the specific problem or need (not necessarily a sin) that the passage aims to address, demonstrating how Scripture speaks directly to real-life concerns. The FCF should be specific and relevant, enabling {audience} to see the immediate significance of the message in their lives. A well-evaluated Bible study will present the text accurately and connect deeply with the listeners by addressing their shared human experiences and conditions, as highlighted in the original context of the Scripture and its application today.

Moreover, the effectiveness of a Bible study is also measured by its applicationâ€”the "so what?" factor that moves beyond mere exposition to practical, life-changing instruction. Ensure that the Bible study transitions smoothly from doctrinal truths to actionable applications, offering clear, Scripture-based guidance for living out the teachings of the Bible in everyday situations. This includes checking if the sermon provides a Christ-centered solution to the FCF, steering clear of simplistic, human-centered fixes, and encouraging listeners toward transformation in the likeness of Christ. A sermon that effectively articulates and applies the FCF, thereby meeting the spiritual needs of the audience with biblical fidelity and practical relevance, is considered well-crafted and impactful.

I greatly value your thorough analysis. Please provide a detailed Bible study that meets these criteria on the topic of "{desired_topic}" for "{audience}" drawn from {reference}. Write it as engagingly as possible, ensuring that it is both theologically sound and practically relevant to the lives of {audience}, avoiding unnecessary jargon. Listeners usually don't understand when you use the term "Fallen Condition Focus (FCF)", please avoid it. Instead, focus on the real-life challenges and practical applications of the passage. Ensure that the Bible study is engaging, theologically sound, and practically relevant to the lives of {audience}. Your Bible study should be 500-word long, providing a clear, concise, and compelling message, remembering that not all the your listeners are familiar with the Bible or are even Christians. Please share the Gospel in a way that is clear and accessible to all."""
