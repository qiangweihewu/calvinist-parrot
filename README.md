# Calvinist Parrot

## Introduction

Calvinist Parrot is an AI-driven application that provides users with insights and interpretations of the Bible through the lens of Reformed theology. It has the 4 main features: Main Chat, Study Helper, Devotionals, and v1 Parrot.

## Features
<!-- - **[Main Chat](https://calvinistparrot.com/Main_Chat)**: This is the main chat. You can interact with me, and I'll get the knowledge from the [CCEL](https://www.ccel.org/). -->
- **[v1 Parrot](https://calvinistparrot.com/v1_Parrot)**: You can chat with me here. I'll try to answer your questions based on my knowledge and understanding of the Bible from a Reformed perspective.
- **[CCEL](https://calvinistparrot.com/CCEL)**: You can search the [Christian Classics Ethereal Library](https://ccel.org) here. I'll try to find the best match for your query.
- **[Study Helper](https://calvinistparrot.com/Study_Helper)**: I'm creating a knowledge base from the commentaries on [Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/commentaries). Ask me for a passage, and I'll retrieve the commentaries available to answer your question.
- **[Devotionals](https://calvinistparrot.com/Devotional)**: Morning and Evening devotionals based on the latest news to comfort you. Remember, AI generates these ðŸ˜‰.
