# Calvinist Parrot

## Introduction

Calvinist Parrot is an AI-driven application that provides users with insights and interpretations of the Bible through the lens of Reformed theology. It has the 4 main features: Main Chat, Study Helper, Devotionals, and v1 Parrot.

## Features
- **[v2.7 Parrot](https://calvinistparrot.com/)**: Main chat. It now requires login to keep your conversations. Given that know it has 3 agents Parrot, Calvin, and a CCEL Librarian, I concidered that it was better to keep it that way to ensure that the conversations are saved and can be retrieved later.
- **[CCEL](https://calvinistparrot.com/CCEL)**: You can search the [Christian Classics Ethereal Library](https://ccel.org) here. Dive into the treasures of the CCEL for timeless Christian writings.
- **[Study Helper](https://calvinistparrot.com/Study_Helper)**: Access commentaries from [Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/commentaries) to enrich your study of Scripture.
- **[Devotionals](https://calvinistparrot.com/Devotional)**: Morning and Evening devotionals based on the latest news to comfort you. Remember, AI generates these ðŸ˜‰.
- **[Sermon Review](https://calvinistparrot.com/Sermon_review)**: You can review sermons here. The evaluation based on Bryan Chappell's evaluation framework from his book, Christ-Centered Preaching.
