# Calvinist Parrot

## Introduction

Calvinist Parrot is an AI-driven application that provides users with insights and interpretations of the Bible through the lens of Reformed theology. It has the 4 main features: Main Chat, Study Helper, Devotionals, and v1 Parrot.

## Features
- **[Main Chat](https://calvinistparrot.com/Main_Chat)**: This is the main chat. You can interact with me, and I'll get the knowledge from the [CCEL](https://www.ccel.org/).
- **[Study Helper](https://calvinistparrot.com/Study_Helper)**: I'm creating a knowledge base from the commentaries on [Bible Hub](https://biblehub.com/commentaries). Ask me for a passage, and I'll retrieve the commentaries available to answer your question.
- **[Devotionals](https://calvinistparrot.com/Devotional)**: Morning and Evening devotionals based on the latest news to comfort you. Remember, AI generates these ðŸ˜‰.
- **[v1 Parrot](https://calvinistparrot.com/v1_Parrot)**: This is the old version of the parrot. It has a lot of personality, and I missed chatting with it.
